This page covers setting up a proper development environment so you can focus on making cool things instead of fighting your editor. You may already be comfortable with your own setup and that's okay. The important thing to know is most RebornBuddy development involves .NET Framework 4.8, C#, WinForms, XML, JSON, and maybe WPF. Source control and project distribution are done with git and GitHub. Furthermore, this site can't cover all programming and tooling topics -- consider it a primer. It's expected and essential to search online and ask questions in #rb-bootcamp . Visual Studio Community Edition \u00b6 Visual Studio Community Edition is a free \"Integrated Development Environment\" (IDE), which is big talk for a fancy text editor aimed at programmers. It helps you write code easier thanks to auto-complete, syntax highlighting, error checking, auto-formatting, etc. Installing Visual Studio \u00b6 Download and run the installer . Continue until you reach the Workloads screen. Already installed Visual Studio? Run Visual Studio Installer from the Windows Start Menu and click Modify to find the same screen. Install the following options from each tab: Workloads: .NET Desktop Development Individual Components: .NET: .NET 5.x-6.x Runtimes .NET Core 3.1 Runtime .NET Framework 3.5 Development Tools .NET Framework 4.6-4.8.x Targeting Packs .NET Framework 4.6-4.8.x SDKs Code Tools: Git for Windows Configuring Visual Studio \u00b6 Below are some common settings worth changing: Color Theme: Tools > Options > Environment > Color Theme : (Blue|Dark|Light|System) Line Numbers: Tools > Options > Text Editors > All Languages > check Line Numbers (may start as a square; click until checked) Extensions for Visual Studio \u00b6 Install the following extensions by opening each link and clicking Download : Code Cleanup on Save - Auto format and code cleanup on save. Enable it in Tools > Options > Environment > Code Cleanup on Save . Markdown Editor v2 - Live preview while editing Markdown ( .md ) documents. Visual Studio Spell Checker - Spell check in comments, strings, etc. Visual Studio Code \u00b6 Visual Studio Code is a general purpose text editor. It's lighter weight than \"real\" Visual Studio and can be extended with plugins, so it's useful for editing text files like .md and .xml , or using programming languages not supported by Visual Studio. Installing Visual Studio Code \u00b6 Download and install Visual Studio Code. Extensions for Visual Studio Code \u00b6 Install the following extensions: C# for VS Code - C# language support and auto-formatting. EditorConfig for VS Code - Auto-format according to the project's .editorconfig rules-file. GitHub Markdown Preview Pack - Properly preview GitHub-flavored Markdown. Indent Rainbow - Colorize indentation by depth. Helps spot related code. Spell Checker - Stop misspelling your code and comments! XML Tools - Useful XML helpers, especially auto-formatting. Configuring Visual Studio Code \u00b6 In Visual Studio Code, press Ctrl + Shift + P , type settings.json , then choose \"Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)\". Replace with the following: { \"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled\" : true , \"editor.guides.bracketPairs\" : \"active\" , \"editor.fontFamily\" : \"'Fira Code', Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace\" , \"editor.fontLigatures\" : true , \"editor.formatOnPaste\" : true , \"editor.formatOnSave\" : true , \"editor.renderLineHighlight\" : \"all\" , \"editor.renderWhitespace\" : \"all\" , \"files.eol\" : \"\\n\" , \"files.insertFinalNewline\" : true , \"files.trimFinalNewlines\" : true , \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\" : true , \"workbench.colorTheme\" : \"Visual Studio Dark\" , \"workbench.iconTheme\" : \"vs-seti\" , \"workbench.startupEditor\" : \"none\" , \"[csharp]\" : { \"editor.defaultFormatter\" : \"ms-dotnettools.csharp\" }, \"[xml]\" : { \"editor.tabSize\" : 2 , \"editor.defaultFormatter\" : \"DotJoshJohnson.xml\" } } WinMerge \u00b6 WinMerge is a \"diff-tool\" that helps compare different versions of a file and combine them into a final merged version. This is useful for figuring out what's changed in a file, or resolving multiple people editing the same file simultaneously. Installing WinMerge \u00b6 Download and run the WinMerge Installer . Check Add WinMerge folder to your system path during the last step before installing: Configuring WinMerge \u00b6 In WinMerge, open Edit > Options... > Backup Files . Uncheck all \"Create backup files in:\" options to avoid .bak files being created when merging files. git Source Control \u00b6 git is source control software -- it helps us organize source code, compare and combine different versions of the same files, and collaborate with other developers a lot easier. No more guessing what you changed or which copy is newer; significantly less hassle incorporating the work of others; and no more disorganized manual backups. You can even rewind to older versions if a new change didn't work out! Using git \u00b6 Learning git can take a bit , but the fundamental ideas are: Source code is stored in a repository , which contains the complete history every change to every file. Each change is called a commit , which represents a distinct version of the code. Commits include the exact details of how each file changed and a small patch note written by the developer. Repositories can be rewound or fast forwarded to any commit, allowing developers to retrieve any version of the program or undo bad changes. It's like time travel! Repositories can also be branched for development in a separate copy of the code. This is great for isolating big or experimental features until they're ready to be merged back to the main branch. Everyone gets their own copy of the repository that can be synced by a series of pushes and pulls . Luckily, git is really good at auto-merging different people's work, but may ask you for help getting it right in tricky situations. In practice, the main commands/workflow to know: git init to start a project. git add . + git commit to submit changes. git push + git pull to trade changes with others. Check out Ry's git Tutorial and search the internet for more articles and videos to learn from. Installing git \u00b6 Git for Windows was installed alongside Visual Studio, but can be installed separately if needed. If installing yourself, enable the following options: Windows Explorer Integration: Git Bash Here Git LFS (Large File Support) Configuring git \u00b6 Open Git Bash from the Windows Start Menu and run the follow commands: Manually edit these lines to set the commit author details: # Commit author details; these are required AND public! # Use an email attached to your GitHub account for credit. # Can also use UserName@users.noreply.github.com for privacy. git config --global user.name \"Your Name\" git config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\" Copy/paste this entire block; no modification needed: # Tool Integrations git config --global merge.tool \"winmerge\" git config --replace --global mergetool.winmerge.cmd \"WinMergeU.exe -e -u -o \\\"\\$MERGED\\\" -dl \\\"Local\\\" -dm \\\"Base\\\" -dr \\\"Remote\\\" \\\"\\$LOCAL\\\" \\\"\\$BASE\\\" \\\"\\$REMOTE\\\"\" git config --global mergetool.prompt \"false\" git config --global diff.tool \"winmerge\" git config --replace --global difftool.winmerge.cmd \"WinMergeU.exe -e -u -dl \\\"Old\\\" -dr \\\"New\\\" \\\"\\$LOCAL\\\" \\\"\\$REMOTE\\\"\" git config --global difftool.prompt \"false\" git config --global gpg.program \" $( where gpg ) \" # Usability git config --global push.default \"simple\" git config --global push.followTags \"true\" git config --global status.showUntrackedFiles \"all\" git config --global core.autocrlf \"true\" git config --global color.ui \"true\" # Aliases/Shortcuts/Macros git config --global alias.hist \"log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'\" git config --global alias.stash-all \"stash save --include-untracked\" GitHub \u00b6 GitHub is a popular website that hosts git repositories (source code) and helps developers collaborate on projects. It has free public and private repositories, good documentation, issue tracking, automatic build servers, download distribution, and more. All this makes it a good choice of host for new projects. Signing Up for GitHub \u00b6 Register at GitHub.com -- the free account is enough. Choose a good, safe-for-work username. It's painful to change later because it breaks all existing links to your repositories, among other troubles. Use a good password and STRONGLY consider enabling TOTP two-factor authentication . Compromised developer accounts are gold; don't wait until it's too late. Use LastPass alongside Authy or LastPass Authenticator if you lack a password or 2FA manager. What's Next? \u00b6 Now that you have the tools, it's time to learn how to use them: Don't know C#? Consider the Yellow Book , or find other tutorials to your taste. Haven't used git ? See Ry's git Tutorial to start versioning and collaborating on code. New to GitHub? git and GitHub aren't the same thing -- learn more here .

It automates tedious gameplay like grinding or mass crafting, allowing you to relax or even AFK while it does your bidding. Add-ons are the lifeblood of RebornBuddy -- the bot is almost useless without them. Luckily, there are plenty of free and paid community add-ons to do almost anything. If not, you can always create or commission your own custom add-ons ! This page will cover buying and installing RebornBuddy itself, then getting popular add-ons for a good start. Buying RebornBuddy \u00b6 RebornBuddy requires a monthly subscription and product keys are available on RebornBuddy.com . Unlike the game's own subscription, where you endlessly top-up the same account, RebornBuddy keys disposable and you simply get a new one as they expire. This also means it won't auto-renew and charge you unexpectedly. Keys are available in 1 or 6 month increments and with 1 or 3 simultaneous sessions. Multi-session keys let you log into the bot multiple times at once, such as when multi-boxing or sharing keys with trusted friends. The bot generally costs less when buying more months or sessions at once. Can't find your RebornBuddy key? Keys are delivered in an e-mail titled \"RebornBuddy Key Purchase\" -- wait a bit longer or check junk mail folders. If the e-mail is still missing and you're already registered on Buddy Auth, the new key might be available on the Keys page. For further support, create a ticket on RebornBuddy's ZenDesk . Registering on Buddy Auth \u00b6 After buying, register on Buddy Auth with the same e-mail used during purchase. This site offers key lists and session management -- useful if the bot crashes and prevents logins due to \"max sessions\". If your new key isn't already listed under the Keys tab, simply add it to your Buddy Auth account under the Attach Key tab. Installing RebornBuddy \u00b6 Download RebornBuddy . Before extracting, unblock the .zip file to avoid issues later. Extract RebornBuddy to a known location. In Windows Defender, exclude the entire RebornBuddy folder . On Anti-Virus Exclusions Please be safe and use critical thinking when excluding things from anti-virus. RebornBuddy is probably okay and doesn't trigger VirusTotal , but this is your own informed choice to make. In this case, Windows Defender dislikes that RebornBuddy (necessarily) interacts with the game's memory, so excluding it will save you the pain of RebornBuddy.exe being quarantined/deleted every update. While fully logged into a character, launch RebornBuddy.exe . Insert your product key and click Login : Wait for the bot to fully load and logs to stop scrolling. If you've made it this far without incident, congratulations! The next step is installing key add-ons so the bot is actually useful. Installing RepoBuddy and Other Add-Ons \u00b6 RepoBuddy is recommended to easily install and automatically update all types of add-ons. It includes the most popular stuff by default, so RepoBuddy is probably the only plugin most users need to install manually. Close RebornBuddy if it's already running. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 . Choose the vcredist_x64.exe version. Download repoBuddy-master.zip . Before extracting, unblock the .zip file to avoid issues later. Extract RepoBuddy to RebornBuddy\\Plugins\\ , removing -master so it looks like: RebornBuddy \u2514\u2500\u2500 Plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 repoBuddy \u251c\u2500\u2500 repoBuddy.cs \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... Launch RebornBuddy. In the Plugins tab, enable \"repoBuddy\" and wait for the bot to restart. Click the \"repoBuddy\" line, then the Settings button to the right. Under One-Time Downloads , install \"Magitek\" and \"Lisbeth\". At the top, click \"Restart RebornBuddy\". Wait for installation to finish and the logs to show: [repoBuddy] RB fully loaded! You now have most everything needed to use RebornBuddy like a pro, including auto-updates!
